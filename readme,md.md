Fraud Detection Model
This is a machine learning model that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on certain parameters. The model was trained on the train.csv file using a neural network and tested on the test.csv file. The predictions were saved to a file named predictions.csv.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

pandas

pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
Usage
To run the model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-model.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash

cd fraud-detection-model
Run the model.py script.
python model.py

python model.py


The predictions will be saved to a file named predictions.csv.
File Descriptions
train.csv: This file contains the training data used to train the model.

test.csv: This file contains the test data used to test the model.

Model Details

The model used in this project is a neural network with the following architecture:

Input layer with 10 nodes (corresponding to the 10 parameters in the dataset)
Hidden layer with 20 nodes and ReLU activation function
Hidden layer with 10 nodes and ReLU activation function
Output layer with 1 node and sigmoid activation function (to produce a probability between 0 and 1)
The model was trained using binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer. The training was stopped early using a callback based on validation loss to prevent overfitting. The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the training data and 96% on the validation data.
